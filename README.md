## Car Rental Web Platform

This web-based platform for car rentals leverages APIs, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS for a seamless user experience.

## Demo: [link]

**Note:** Due to a glitch in newer versions of NEXT JS related to searching, this project uses a different approach to avoid the issue. However, this approach does not save search settings to the URL.

## API 
- Cars by API-Ninjas:  https://rapidapi.com/apininjas/api/cars-by-api-ninjas/
- IMAGIN.studio API:  https://cdn.imagin.studio/getimage
### Getting Started

Since the latest version of NEXT JS is used, initialize your project with:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest ./
```

### Dependencies

- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- App Router

### Running the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the result.

### Editing the Page

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

### Font Optimization

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
